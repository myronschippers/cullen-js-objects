# JavaScript Object Review

## Object Review

Objects are a data type that allows us to store multiple pieces of information together inside a single variable.

Each piece of data inside an object is called a **property**. Also sometimes called a **key**. Each **property** has a value. The value can be any legal JavaScript data type including Numbers, Strings, Arrays, other objects, or even Functions.
